 * @brief   Plugin-settings row defining one designer-configurable nav layer.
 *          Up to 7 layers map to bits 1..7 of the agent / blocker layer mask
 *          on `FSeinMovementData::NavLayerMask` and `FSeinExtentsData::
 *          BlockedNavLayerMask`.
 *
 *          NOTE: the "Default" layer is NOT in this array — it's reserved as
 *          bit 0 and always present. These 7 slots are exclusively for
 *          additional agent classes a game needs (Amphibious, HeavyVehicle,
 *          FriendlyFaction, etc.).
 *
 *          Bit-index stability: renaming a slot is safe; reordering / inserting
 *          IS NOT (shifts every higher-index slot's bit, breaks replays + saves).
 *          Only append or rename.
