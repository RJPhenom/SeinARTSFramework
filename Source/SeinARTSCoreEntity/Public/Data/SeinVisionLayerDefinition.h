 * @brief   Plugin-settings row defining one designer-configurable vision layer
 *          (DESIGN.md §12). Up to 6 layers map to the 6 N-bits in the per-cell
 *          EVNNNNNN bitfield (bits 2..7).
 *
 *          NOTE: the "Normal" / default-visibility layer is NOT in this array.
 *          It's reserved by the framework and always maps to the V bit (bit 1)
 *          of the EVNNNNNN bitfield. Designers reference the default layer by
 *          the name "Normal" on entity PerceptionLayers / EmissionLayers,
 *          without declaring it here.
 *
 *          Plugin settings ship 6 slots (N0..N5). Slot index N → bitfield bit
 *          (2 + N). Slot index is canonical; renaming a slot is safe,
 *          reordering / inserting IS NOT (breaks replays).

 * Configure in Project Settings > Plugins > SeinARTS > Vision Layers. The
 * framework-default "Normal" layer is NOT part of this array — it's always the
 * V bit, hardcoded. These 6 slots are exclusively for additional layers a game
 * needs beyond generic visibility: Stealth, Thermal, Radar, DetectorPerception,
 * Acoustic, Infrared, etc.
 *
 * Bit-index stability:
 *  - `bEnabled` toggles the slot without shifting bit indices — disabling a
 *    layer mid-development is safe.
 *  - Renaming a slot is safe.
 *  - Reordering or inserting entries into the middle of the array IS NOT safe
 *    (shifts every higher-index slot's bit, breaking replays + save games).
 *    Only append or rename.
