/**
 * RTS-aware player start point.
 *
 * Each SeinPlayerStart represents one player slot on the map. The GameMode
 * matches connecting players to starts by PlayerSlot, then spawns the
 * faction's SpawnEntity at this location.
 *
 * ## Editor Workflow
 * Place one SeinPlayerStart per player position in the map. Set PlayerSlot
 * to 1, 2, 3, etc. The GameMode assigns connecting players to slots in
 * order (or via lobby/matchmaker assignment).
 *
 * ## SpawnEntity
 * The SpawnEntity is an ASeinActor Blueprint that represents the faction's
 * starting presence (e.g., a headquarters building). Its BeginPlay / abilities
 * can trigger any game-start logic the designer wants (spawn workers, grant
 * starting tech, etc.). This keeps start-of-game setup entirely in Blueprint.
 *
 * ## Networked / Lobby Use
 * For matchmaking or skirmish lobbies, the lobby system assigns each player
 * a target slot index before travel. The GameMode's HandleStartingNewPlayer
 * then matches the player to the SeinPlayerStart with the corresponding
 * PlayerSlot value.
