/**
 * SeinARTS Framework - Copyright (c) 2026 Phenom Studios, Inc.
 * @file    SeinFogOfWarDefault.h
 * @brief   Reference implementation of USeinFogOfWar. Grid loads from a
 *          USeinFogOfWarDefaultAsset (bake output) when available; auto-sizes
 *          from ASeinFogOfWarVolumes when not. MVP stamp is flat-circle;
 *          shadowcast + lampshade + per-player + custom layers land in
 *          subsequent passes.
 *
 *          Determinism contract:
 *          - Stamp output (CellBitfield): fully FFixedPoint. StampFlatCircle
 *            uses FFixedPoint radius math + cell² integer comparisons; no
 *            float on the stamp path.
 *          - Stamp cadence: driven by USeinWorldSubsystem::OnSimTickCompleted
 *            gated by plugin-settings VisionTickInterval. All clients stamp
 *            against the same tick-N source snapshot — lockstep-safe.
 *          - LOS query: FSeinLineOfSightResolver takes FFixedVector; no
 *            float round-trip between sim caller and impl cell lookup.
 *          - Grid layout (Width/Height/Origin/CellSize): derived from AVolume
 *            bounds via FromFloat. Deterministic on IEEE-754 targets with
 *            stock UE floating-point modes (the platforms UE5 ships for).
 *          - Bake is editor-only. Produces quantized per-cell Ground +
 *            Blocker heights stored in USeinFogOfWarDefaultAsset; runtime
 *            dequantizes into FFixedPoint arrays on load.
 *          - Debug viz (CollectDebugCellQuads): float conversions at the
 *            FFixedPoint → FVector boundary, render-only, not sim state.
 *
 *          Upgrades in later passes:
 *          - Shadowcast + lampshade eye-height blocker test (CoH TrueSight)
 *          - Per-player VisionGroup grids + ownership filter
 *          - 6 custom layer bits (Stealth, Thermal, etc.)
 *          - Stamp-delta refcount (only recompute on cell-cross / prop change)
