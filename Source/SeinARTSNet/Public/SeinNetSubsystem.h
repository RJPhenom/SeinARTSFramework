/**
 * SeinARTS Framework - Copyright (c) 2026 Phenom Studios, Inc.
 * @file    SeinNetSubsystem.h
 * @brief   Game-instance subsystem orchestrating the lockstep network layer.
 *
 * Responsibilities (Phase 0):
 *   - On the server, spawn an ASeinNetRelay per APlayerController as it joins
 *     (FGameModeEvents::GameModePostLoginEvent), destroy on logout. Owner =
 *     the PC, so the client legitimately owns its relay for ServerRPC.
 *   - Track all server-side relays + the one client-side local relay.
 *   - Provide SubmitLocalCommand() as the single client entry point.
 *   - Phase 0 server aggregation is a passthrough: incoming submission is
 *     immediately fanned back out to every relay's ClientRPC. Phase 2
 *     replaces this with real per-turn buffering.
 *
 * Networking is gated on:
 *     USeinARTSCoreSettings::bNetworkingEnabled  AND
 *     World->GetNetMode() != NM_Standalone
 * If either is false the subsystem stays alive but every entry point is a
 * no-op — single-player builds are zero-overhead.
